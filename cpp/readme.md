# C++

He you can find the C++ source use to create the simulation.
Note that in the end C# was use for the simulation so this source doesn't have a proper working simulation.

## Build

You will need to build the [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter) project to be able to used this source.

## Acknowledgement

A lot of the code are modified version of the [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorial.
